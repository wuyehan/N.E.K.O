"""
EmbeddingService — Tier 0 of the memory hierarchy: vector embeddings.

Provides ``embed(text)`` / ``embed_batch(texts)`` over the local CPU ONNX
text-retrieval embedding profile. Used by:

  * fact dedup at write time (cosine > threshold → LLM arbitration queue)
  * persona / reflection retrieval (cosine top-K → LLM rerank precandidates)

This module owns the *fallback gate*. The whole feature degrades to
zero-cost if any of the following holds:

  * ``onnxruntime`` cannot be imported
  * the ONNX model file is missing on disk
  * detected RAM < ``VECTORS_MIN_RAM_GB``
  * the user set ``VECTORS_ENABLED = False``
  * ``auto`` quantization when AVX-VNNI is **confirmed absent** (no INT8
    fast-path; default installs omit the large FP32 ONNX bundle — operators
    who need vectors then pin ``int8`` or ship FP32 weights + ``fp32``)
  * loading or any per-call inference raised an exception (sticky disable)

Explicit ``fp32`` loads ``model.onnx`` when present (manual / optional bundle).

When disabled, ``is_available()`` returns False; callers MUST check it
before invoking ``embed()`` / ``embed_batch()`` and fall back to the
pre-vector code path. The disable is process-local and final — once
``DISABLED`` we don't retry within the same process.

Lazy load: the model file is NOT loaded at startup. The
warmup is gated on the first ``request_load()`` call from
memory_server's post-ready hook (after the frontend has finished its
greeting / prominent drain). Until ``READY``, ``embed()`` returns None.

Embedding cache invalidation lives on the entry dict itself:

  * ``embedding``: list[float] | None
  * ``embedding_text_sha256``: str | None
  * ``embedding_model_id``: str | None

A reader treats the cached embedding as valid only when both fingerprints
match the current text + service ``model_id()`` — same pattern as the
``token_count`` cache PR-3 introduced.

# ── on-disk vector encoding ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A 256d float vector serialized as JSON ``list[float]`` runs ~5.3 KB
# (each float prints to ~21 chars after Python's repr). We instead
# store ``base64(fp16_bytes)`` — raw little-endian fp16 of the
# L2-normalized vector. Decode is:
#
#     raw = b64decode(s)
#     vec = np.frombuffer(raw, dtype=np.float16).astype(np.float32)
#
# Total bytes = ``2 * dim``; base64 ≈ ``ceil(2 * dim * 4/3)``. At 256d
# that is ~684 chars vs ~5.3 KB before — ~8× smaller, and the decoder
# lands in a contiguous numpy buffer so the recall path can stack
# candidates into a matrix and use ``M @ q.T`` instead of the pure-
# Python cosine loop.
#
# Why fp16 instead of int8: L2-normalized vectors have typical
# per-axis magnitudes ~1/√dim; in that range fp16's mantissa step is
# ~2⁻¹⁴ ≈ 6e-5, giving cosine error ~5e-4 over a 256-dim dot — well
# below LLM-rerank perceptibility. int8 with a per-vector scale would
# only buy 2× more compression but trade in quantization noise (~0.4%
# per dim, ~1% cumulative cosine), an extra fp16 scale prefix, the
# clip/round machinery, and a fresh attack surface around NaN scales.
# At our scale (small thousand-entry corpus) the marginal compression
# is invisible; simpler wire format wins.

    Responsibilities (intentionally narrow — fact / persona / reflection
    subsystems own everything around this class):

      1. Resolve the runtime model id from hardware + config
      2. Lazy-load the ONNX session on first ``request_load()``
      3. Provide ``embed`` / ``embed_batch`` once READY
      4. Be a sticky kill switch: once DISABLED, every method returns
         the safe "no embedding" answer for the rest of the process

    Thread/coroutine safety: ``request_load()`` is idempotent under
    concurrent callers thanks to the asyncio.Lock; embedding calls are
    naturally serialized through ``asyncio.to_thread`` and the
    onnxruntime session itself releases the GIL during inference.

    Both ``embed()`` outputs are L2-normalized, so this is a straight
    dot product — no division required. Accepts the canonical base64
    form, legacy ``list[float]``, or an already-decoded numpy array;
    decodes lazily so the per-pair API stays compatible with tests and
    fact-dedup's single-pair callsite. For hot loops over thousands of
    candidates, prefer building a stacked matrix once via
    :func:`decode_embedding` and using ``M @ q`` — the recall path does
    that.

    Out-of-band inputs (None, empty, dim mismatch, malformed base64)

    ranking around an unrankable candidate than crashing because one
    entry was missing its embedding.

      * the payload actually decodes (corrupt base64 → invalid)

    carrying two on-disk shapes forward indefinitely.

    Without the decode + dim check, a corrupt cache row would pass the
    typeof guard, never get re-stamped by the worker (it keeps
    "validating"), and silently fall through to the unembedded pool in
    every recall — a permanent retrieval-quality regression for that
    entry (Codex review on PR #1147).

    Any mismatch → False, callers should clear the embedding fields and
