"""
Background warmup + batch-fill loop for vector embeddings.

Two responsibilities, one loop so we share the lifecycle and the
"vectors disabled → nothing to do, exit silently" logic:

1. **Warmup gating.** The ONNX model file is ~150 MB and the first
   decompress can hold the GIL for several seconds. We refuse to load
   it during cold boot (which would inflate first-paint of the
   frontend). Instead we wait for whichever comes first:

     * the warmup delay elapses (configurable, default 30 s)
     * the user hits ``/process`` for the first time (signal that the
       greeting / prominent drain has finished and there's a real
       conversation underway)

   Then we call ``EmbeddingService.request_load()`` once. After that
   the service is either READY (carry on) or DISABLED (exit loop —
   nothing else for this worker to do for the rest of the process).

2. **Batch backfill.** Once READY, scan persona / reflection / facts
   for entries whose ``embedding`` is None (or whose stored model_id
   doesn't match the current service id, indicating a config/dim flip
   since the last process). Embed them in batches of N, write back to
   disk through the existing save APIs. Throttled so we don't peg the
   CPU during normal use.

Failure semantics: any exception inside the loop is logged but doesn't
propagate — this is a best-effort backfill, not a critical path.
A retry happens on the next poll interval. Sticky service-level
disable propagates correctly because ``EmbeddingService`` itself
flips to DISABLED on the first inference failure, and our
``is_available()`` short-circuit catches it on the next iteration.
