MemoryRecallReranker — vector pre-rank + LLM rerank for memory recall.

Step 3 of P2.  Replaces the "top-N by evidence_score" heuristic that
``FactStore._aload_signal_targets`` uses today to pick candidates for
the Stage-2 signal-detection LLM call.  The new pipeline is:

  1. **Hard filter** — exclude entries with ``evidence_score < 0``,
     suppressed entries, terminal-status reflections, and persona
     entries marked ``protected`` (character-card sources).  Same
     semantics as today's render-time filters.

  2. **Coarse rank (vectors)** — when the EmbeddingService is
     available AND the caller passed in query texts (typically the
     newly-extracted facts), embed the queries, compute max-cosine
     between each candidate and any query, sort DESC, keep the top
     ``budget * COARSE_OVERSAMPLE`` rows (default 3 ×).  Without an
     embedding service or without query texts, this stage is a no-op
     and the original list passes through.

  3. **Fine rank (LLM)** — when embeddings produced more than
     ``budget`` candidates AND the LLM rerank prompt is configured,
     send the candidate set + query texts to a small LLM call asking
     for the most relevant ``budget`` items.  ``evidence_score`` is
     surfaced in the prompt as an auxiliary signal ("this entry has
     been confirmed N times by the user") rather than mixed into the
     ranking math — the LLM weighs it together with semantic
     relevance.  When the LLM call fails or vectors are off, the
     coarse-rank order (or evidence_score when even coarse failed)
     is used as the final order.

Fallback: when ``EmbeddingService`` is permanently disabled, the
whole pipeline degrades to "evidence_score DESC + top ``budget``" —
exactly the current behaviour, no LLM call cost added.

Why vectors are a *prefilter*, not a replacement: cosine alone can't
tell ``主人喜欢猫`` from ``主人讨厌猫`` (≈0.78), and "semantically
near" entries that the user didn't actually mean to bring up trigger
false positives in Stage-2 signal detection (which would either
reinforce or negate the wrong observation).  Keeping the LLM as the
arbiter means we save *prompt tokens* (smaller candidate set in the
Stage-2 prompt), not *LLM calls* — RFC §3.4 stays unchanged in
shape.

        与 ``aretrieve_candidates`` 的全局 max-pool top-K 不同：这里**每条
        query 各自享有 ``per_query_k`` 的独立配额**，结果按 id dedup 合并，
        总数截到 ``total_cap``。

        Use case：reflection synthesis 的 ``{RELATED_CONTEXT_BLOCK}``——20 条
        unabsorbed fact 主题分散时，max-pool 会让冷门主题被高频主题挤掉，
        per-query 配额规避这点（PR #1401 thread 拍板）。

        Perf：单次 ``embed_batch`` 拼所有 query，candidates decode 一次成 (N, D)
        矩阵，一次 ``candidate_matrix @ query_matrix.T`` 算出 (N, Q) 分数矩

        BLAS 自带 SIMD/多线程，等同于"并行"per-query 调用但不付 N 次嵌入
        服务往返。

        Fallback 与主路径不同：embedding 不可用 / 无 model_id / 候选无 valid
        embedding → **直接返回 []**，**不**退化到 evidence_score 排序。理由：
        本方法的消费者（``_build_related_context_block``）拿结果是当
        "semantic anchor" 注入 LLM prompt 用的，没真 semantic 关联的"高分历史
        fact"当锚反而是注意力污染——宁可空 anchor。

        ⚠️ 代码重用：candidate matrix build / query decode 与 ``_coarse_rank``
        基本一致；当前两份接受少量重复，等出现第三个 caller 时再抽
        ``_build_score_matrix`` 私有 helper。
