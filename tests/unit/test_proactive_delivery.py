"""Unit tests for the generic ProactiveDeliveryManager front stage.

Covers the behaviours the manager adds in front of the existing enqueue/
trigger delivery core: priority ordering (HIGHER = more important, unspecified
0 = least), OPT-IN coalescing, the playback gate (don't release while audio
plays), BATCHED release (cues piled up while speaking go out together in one
turn), min-gap pacing, and drain-on-teardown (cues are handed back, never
silently dropped).
