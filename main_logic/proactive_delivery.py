"""Generic, plugin-agnostic proactive-delivery pacing/ordering front stage.

Problem (observed in voice mode especially): proactive cues — plugin
``push_message(ai_behavior="respond")``, greeting, agent task results — are
produced far faster than the assistant can speak them, and the legacy gate
released the next cue on the realtime API's ``response.done`` (generation
finished) while the FRONTEND was still playing buffered audio. Result: she
talks non-stop / interrupts herself, and a low-value "state digest" cue
competes equally with an urgent "you got hit" cue.

This manager sits IN FRONT of the existing, race-tested
``LLMSessionManager.enqueue_agent_callback`` + ``trigger_agent_callbacks``
delivery core (it does NOT replace it). It owns the WAITING cues and decides
WHICH cue and WHEN to hand one off, applying:

* **Priority ordering** — HIGHER number = more important (the repo-wide
  convention shared by existing producers: bilibili gift/SC=9, memo
  reminder=8, study answer_evaluated=5, and the HUD ``priority_min`` filter).
  ``priority`` arrives from ``push_message(priority=...)``; unspecified
  default (0) = least important, so a cue that set a priority always outranks
  one that didn't. minecraft is tagged on the same scale (alert highest).
* **Coalescing** — OPT-IN: queued cues sharing an explicit ``coalesce_key``
  collapse to the newest. An unset key never coalesces (unique per cue), so
  no existing plugin regresses by having distinct cues silently dropped.
  Minecraft opts in per category (alert / completion / in_progress /
  keep_going).
* **Batched + playback gate** — cues that pile up while she is speaking are
  released TOGETHER as one batch (the legacy "one LLM turn for several
  near-simultaneous cues" behaviour), and never while audio is playing.
  Release happens after the FRONTEND reports ``voice_play_end`` (or
  ``text_end``), plus a min-gap. Only one batch is in flight at a time.
* **Min-gap pacing** — never release within ``min_gap_s`` of the last
  playback end (anti-flood).
* **Preemption / staleness** — when the gate opens the current highest
  priority cue wins the slot; a cue that has waited longer than ``ttl_s``
  is dropped rather than spoken stale.

The manager runs entirely inside the asyncio event loop; all public methods
are synchronous and schedule the actual (awaitable) hand-off via
``create_task``. There is therefore no internal lock — the single-threaded
loop serialises everything between ``await`` points.
