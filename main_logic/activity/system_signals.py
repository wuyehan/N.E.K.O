"""System-wide signal collector for the user-activity tracker.

A single process-wide singleton ``SystemSignalCollector`` polls
Windows for:

  * Keyboard/mouse idle seconds (``GetLastInputInfo``) — the only
    reliable system-wide "user is here" signal that doesn't require
    raw input hooks.
  * CPU utilisation (``psutil.cpu_percent``) as both a 30s rolling
    average and the most recent point.
  * Active foreground window — title via ``pygetwindow`` and the
    owning process name via the Win32 thread-process API.

Per-character hooks (user messages, AI replies, voice RMS) live in
``UserActivityTracker`` instead — those are session-scoped and have
no business in a process singleton.

Why a singleton: the OS only has one foreground window and one input
queue, so polling separately per character would just duplicate work.
The collector starts a single asyncio background task on first ``.start()``
and is driven by ``CONFIG.activity.poll_interval_seconds`` (default 5s).
Cheaper than a real polling loop because each tick is ~1 syscall.

Non-Windows fallback: every getter degrades to a no-op; the collector
returns ``SystemSnapshot()`` defaults so the rest of the tracker keeps
working without OS-specific signals.

    Single source of truth for the "is the backend running on a different

    their own copies of this env-var check and drifted:

      * the activity collector here — flips the OS-signal pipeline into
        degraded mode (window/idle/CPU/GPU come from frontend push or
        not at all).
      * ``main_routers/system_router._is_remote_backend_deployment`` —
        blocks local-machine operations like ``/api/screenshot`` from

        to the user. ``main_routers/agent_router`` follows the same
        rule for ``computer_use`` / agent commands.

    Both now call into this function. The check itself is intentionally
    cheap (env lookup) so it's safe to call inline on every request.

    Set to ``1`` / ``true`` / ``yes`` / ``on`` when the backend is on a
    different machine from the user — covers the Windows-remote edge
    case where the local OS APIs would happily report the server's
    foreground window (since pygetwindow technically works), but those
    signals are about the server, not the user. Same applies to
    pyautogui screenshots and computer_use commands — they target the
    backend machine, which is wrong when that machine isn't the user's.

    Default off — most users run backend on their own PC where local
    OS signals / screenshots / computer_use are correct.
