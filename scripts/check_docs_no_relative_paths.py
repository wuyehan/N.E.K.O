"""Static check: forbid markdown links inside ``docs/`` that VitePress can't resolve.

Why this exists
---------------
``docs/`` ships through VitePress, which serves pages from ``docs/`` as the
deploy root and runs a dead-link check at build time: every markdown link is
resolved as a site page, and any target it can't resolve fails the build
(``[vitepress] N dead link(s) found`` → ``exit 1``).  A broken link therefore
breaks deploy on every push.  This lint catches the two recurring forms
*before* merge, so the build doesn't have to be the thing that notices.

What it flags
-------------
Both forms are markdown inline links (``](target)``) outside fenced code
blocks, inside any built ``.md`` file under ``docs/``:

1. **Relative-up** — target starts with ``..`` and escapes the doc root::

       [text](../foo)
       [text](../../static/foo.js)

   We've fixed this more than once — a previous "just one ../static link,
   this once" cost a doc-pipeline cleanup PR.

2. **Source-file** — a *relative* link to a repo source file (``.py``,
   ``.ts``, … optionally with a ``:line`` anchor) that has no doc page::

       [text](utils/token_tracker.py)
       [text](main_routers/system_router.py:194)

   VitePress resolves these against the current doc dir (e.g.
   ``docs/design/security/main_routers/...``), finds nothing, and aborts.
   This is the form that broke the build in the telemetry / local-mutation
   design docs — the ``..`` rule above missed it because the target has no
   leading ``..``.

Absolute URLs (``http(s)://…`` incl. GitHub ``blob`` links), site-absolute
paths (``/logo.jpg``), ``mailto:``, and in-page anchors (``#section``) are
fine and never flagged.  ``..`` text outside the ``](...)`` link form (shell
snippets, prose) is not flagged either.

Build-scope parity
------------------
Only files VitePress actually builds are inspected:
- ``node_modules/`` is skipped (third-party READMEs, never deployed).
- The README translations in ``SRC_EXCLUDE`` are skipped to mirror the
  ``srcExclude`` list in ``docs/.vitepress/config.ts`` — keep the two in
  sync if that list changes.

Suppression
-----------
None.  If you genuinely need to reference a non-docs file, either inline the
path as code (`` `utils/token_tracker.py:194` ``) without a link, or use a
full GitHub URL (``https://github.com/.../blob/main/utils/token_tracker.py``),
or move the content into ``docs/``.  A per-line escape hatch would defeat the
purpose.
