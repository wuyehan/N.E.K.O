Bug 1.6 — Bridge token only accepted via ``?token=...`` query string
====================================================================

The four ``/market/oauth/{status,start,complete,logout}`` endpoints in
``plugin/server/routes/market_bridge.py`` declare bridge token as a
required query parameter::

    token: str = Query(..., description="Bridge token")

The frontend (``frontend/plugin-manager/src/composables/useMarketAuth.ts``)
appends the bridge token to the URL as ``?token=<good>``. That leaks the
token into:

* browser history;
* HTTP ``Referer`` headers when the page later navigates;
* server / reverse-proxy access logs (which routinely capture the full
  request line including query string).

The expected fix is to make the backend accept the token via
``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` header (the new path) while keeping
the ``?token=`` query branch alive for one release as a backward-
compatibility window. See bugfix.md §1.6 / §2.6 and design.md
"Phase 3 — Bridge token via Authorization: Bearer header".

Property under test (Bug Condition C(X) — exploration form)
-----------------------------------------------------------

For *every* endpoint in
``{'/market/oauth/status', '/market/oauth/start', '/market/oauth/complete',
'/market/oauth/logout'}``, a request that

1. carries ``Authorization: Bearer <_BRIDGE_TOKEN>`` (the live process
   token), AND
2. does NOT include ``?token=...`` in its URL,

SHOULD succeed (HTTP 200) once the dual-accept fix lands. Specifically,
``/oauth/start`` returns 200 with an ``auth_url`` (because ``MARKET_URL``
and ``MARKET_WEB_URL`` are populated in this test), ``/oauth/status``
and ``/oauth/complete`` and ``/oauth/logout`` all return 200 with
"unauthenticated / no pending session / logged out" payloads.

This file ASSERTS ``response.status_code == 200`` (the "or non-403"
form from tasks.md 1.3 — see note below). On the **unfixed** code path
the assertion FAILS because the missing required ``?token=`` query
parameter trips FastAPI's Pydantic validation BEFORE ``_verify_token``
even runs, returning ``422 Unprocessable Entity``.

A note on the failure status code
---------------------------------

bugfix.md §1.6 anticipated ``403`` (``_verify_token`` raising
``HTTPException(403, "无效的 bridge token")``). The actual observed
counterexample on unfixed code is ``422`` — FastAPI rejects the
request at the validation layer because the required ``Query(...)``
field is missing, so ``_verify_token`` is never called and there is no
opportunity to fall back to the ``Authorization`` header. The
distinction does not change the bug: the bridge token *cannot* be
delivered via header today, regardless of whether the rejection
materialises as 403 or 422. Asserting ``== 200`` (i.e. "the
authenticated happy path") captures both flavors uniformly.

Documented counterexample
-------------------------

``POST /market/oauth/start`` carrying ``Authorization: Bearer <good>``
and no ``?token=`` returns ``422`` on unfixed code (Pydantic complains
the ``token`` query parameter is required) — proof that the header
channel is not wired in. The dedicated
``test_oauth_start_with_authorization_header_documented_counterexample``
test below pins this exact case for the regression suite.
