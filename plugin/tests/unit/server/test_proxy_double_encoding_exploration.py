"""Bug-condition exploration property test for PR #1480 review item 1.1.

Bug 1.1 — Proxy double Content-Encoding
=======================================

``proxy_user_plugin_market_bridge`` in ``app/main_server.py`` (around
line 1604) forwards the client's ``Accept-Encoding`` upstream, lets
httpx auto-decompress the upstream response body, and then forwards the
upstream ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` header back to the browser. The
browser then sees ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` together with already-
decompressed bytes and fails with ``ERR_CONTENT_DECODING_FAILED``.

Property under test (Bug Condition C(X) — exploration form)
-----------------------------------------------------------

For *every* binary upstream payload ``body`` returned with
``Content-Encoding: gzip``, the response surfaced by the proxy SHOULD
NOT carry a ``Content-Encoding`` header (because the body has already
been decompressed by httpx). The desired post-fix invariant is

    'content-encoding' NOT IN response.headers

This file ASSERTS that invariant. On the **unfixed** code path the
assertion FAILS — the response still carries ``Content-Encoding: gzip``
alongside the decompressed body — which is exactly the observation
that proves the bug exists.

**Documented counterexample**: ``body=b'{"ok":true}'`` round-trips
through the proxy as decompressed JSON bytes that ALSO carry
``Content-Encoding: gzip``, reproducing the browser-visible double
encoding.

**Validates: Requirements 1.1**

    For each generated ``body``:

    1. Mock the upstream ``USER_PLUGIN_BASE`` so that it returns the
       gzip-compressed bytes of ``body`` together with the headers
       ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` + ``Content-Type: application/json``.
       The proxy's internal ``httpx.AsyncClient`` will auto-decompress
       the body on access, so ``upstream.content == body`` while
       ``upstream.headers['content-encoding'] == 'gzip'``.
    2. Drive a request through the real FastAPI app's
       ``proxy_user_plugin_market_bridge`` handler via ASGI.
    3. Assert the post-fix invariant: the response observed by the
       client must NOT carry ``Content-Encoding`` while the body bytes
       equal the original (decompressed) ``body``.

    On the unfixed code, step 3 FAILS — the proxy forwards the upstream
    ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` verbatim. That failure is the bug
    confirmation we want for this exploration test.
