"""Bug-condition exploration property test for PR #1480 review item 1.23.

Bug 1.23 — ``_update_pyproject_dependencies`` regex is not scoped to ``[project]``
==================================================================================

``_update_pyproject_dependencies`` in
``plugin/neko_plugin_cli/commands/deps_cmd.py`` rewrites the
``dependencies`` array of a plugin's ``pyproject.toml`` with a single
unscoped regular expression::

    pattern = re.compile(r"(dependencies\\s*=\\s*)\\[([^\\]]*)\\]", re.DOTALL)
    ...
    content = pattern.sub(replacement, content, count=1)

The pattern matches *any* ``dependencies = [...]`` literal in the file
and rewrites only the **first** occurrence in document order. TOML lets
the literal substring ``dependencies = [...]`` appear in tables that
have nothing to do with ``[project]``: ``[tool.uv]`` (uv's dev-dep
shorthand), ``[tool.poetry.group.dev]`` (Poetry), arbitrary
``[tool.<vendor>]`` tables, and so on. Whenever any such table appears
**before** ``[project]`` in source order, the regex clobbers the wrong
section: it overwrites the unrelated ``dependencies`` field while
``[project].dependencies`` itself stays untouched.

The expected fix (req 2.23, task 2.6.3) restricts the rewrite to the
range ``[project] … <next [section]>`` and revalidates the output by
re-parsing with ``tomllib``. See bugfix.md §1.23 / §2.23 and design.md
"Phase 6 — CLI deps 命令" for the full plan.

Property under test (Bug Condition C(X) — exploration form)
-----------------------------------------------------------

For *every* set of new dependency specifiers ``extra_deps`` (1–3 short
ASCII names), against a ``pyproject.toml`` fixture where ``[tool.uv]``
appears **before** ``[project]`` and both tables happen to declare a
``dependencies`` array, the post-fix invariants

    tomllib.load(path)["project"]["dependencies"]
        == sorted({"existing", *extra_deps}, key=str.lower)

    tomllib.load(path)["tool"]["uv"]["dependencies"]
        == ["red-herring"]                       # byte-unchanged

SHOULD both hold. On the **unfixed** code path BOTH invariants FAIL:

* ``[project].dependencies`` is still ``["existing"]`` (the regex never
  reached this section because it stopped after the first match), AND
* ``[tool.uv].dependencies`` has been silently clobbered with the new
  project-dep list.

That double failure is the observation that confirms the bug exists.

Documented counterexample
-------------------------

A concrete one-shot variant (no Hypothesis) is pinned in
``test_deps_regex_documented_counterexample`` below: the call
``_update_pyproject_dependencies(path, ["existing", "foo>=1"])`` against
the fixture above leaves ``[project].dependencies == ["existing"]``
(untouched) while ``[tool.uv].dependencies`` becomes
``["existing", "foo>=1"]`` (clobbered). That is the simplest one-line
reproducer and the assertion below shows what the **fixed** behaviour
must look like — so the test fails today and passes once req 2.23 is
implemented.

A second test, ``test_deps_regex_unfixed_state_baseline``, asserts the
**current (buggy) wrong-clobber state**. It exists as a bug-condition
baseline: it PASSES on unfixed code (proving the bug is present at the
expected location) and will FAIL once the fix lands — at which point
the ``Phase 6`` fix-checking tests in ``test_pyproject_update_scoped.py``
take over. This baseline is intentionally redundant with the
exploration property and should be removed (or inverted) by whoever
implements task 2.6.3.
