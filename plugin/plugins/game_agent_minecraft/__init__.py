"""Minecraft Game Agent plugin.

Bridges a local Minecraft agent server (WebSocket) to the LLM via the
plugin SDK's ``@llm_tool`` decorator. Replaces the previous in-tree
integration that lived in ``main_logic/core.py`` and ``main_logic/
game_agent_client.py`` (commit ``bca0c5f3`` on the abandoned
``feat/game-agent-integration`` branch). Now everything game-agent-
specific is contained inside this directory and can be installed /
removed without patching core code.

Architecture (one paragraph): ``minecraft_task`` is registered as an
LLM tool via :func:`plugin.sdk.plugin.llm_tool`; when the model picks
it, the plugin sends the task text to the agent server over WebSocket
and blocks the handler on an :class:`asyncio.Event` until the
``task_finished`` frame arrives (or a configurable timeout fires).
Screenshots streamed by the agent server are forwarded into the
realtime LLM session via :class:`push_message v2 <push_message>` with
``ai_behavior="read"`` so they enter the model's vision context. A
background task periodically fires a "GAME_SYSTEM" nudge prompt with
the latest log digest and screenshot cache so the model keeps playing
autonomously when the user is silent.

    "Parameters:\n"
    "  task (string, required): one concrete executable action in "
    "English with specific targets — exact coordinates, specific block "
    "or entity types, specific quantities. Vague intents ('find a good "
    "place to build a house', 'find a blue block', 'come over here') "

    "craft / one walk) over long compound chains; chains complete "
    "piece by piece and each step's real outcome must be observed "
    "before claiming the next.\n"
    "  overwrite (bool, default false): if a previous task is still in "
    "flight, false rejects this call with a 'busy' summary and the "
    "previous task keeps running. Set true when:\n"
    "    (a) the user explicitly tells you to stop / change ('stop', "

    "    (b) you have directly observed the current task is hopelessly "
    "stuck (blocked for 15s+ with zero progress in screenshots), or\n"
    "    (c) the user complains the in-game behavior is wrong (wrong tool, "
    "wrong target, wrong direction) — apply the fix immediately, don't "
    "wait for the current task to finish.\n"
    "  Do NOT set true for 'better plan' / 'more efficient' subjective "
    "reasons. **CRITICAL**: when a 'busy' response comes back AND the user "
    "is actively correcting you, you MUST re-invoke with overwrite=true on "
    "the same turn — silently accepting busy while the user is asking for "
    "a change leaves Neko standing still doing the wrong thing.\n\n"

        The plugin SDK invokes this hook from inside
        ``_async_command_loop`` ([plugin/core/host.py:1216-1225]) before
        the command dispatch loop starts pumping messages. That loop is
        the SAME long-lived asyncio loop that later executes every
        ``@plugin_entry`` / ``@llm_tool`` handler, so the WS client task,
        nudge loop, locks and Events created here all bind to the loop
        the handlers will eventually run on — no cross-loop access risk.

        Earlier iteration of this fix used ``@timer_interval`` + a
        forever-blocking ``asyncio.Event().wait()`` to hold the tick
        open. That worked in the sense that the service tasks survived,
        but the tasks were bound to the timer's per-tick loop in a

        different event loop`` the moment it touched any of the
        service's asyncio primitives. Codex review on PR #1395 caught
        this — using the command-loop hook is the correct primitive.

        air between "go chop trees" → dialog LLM chats but doesn't call

        loop never starts → no self-prompt → Neko stands still until

        dialog LLM. Goal: tell猫娘 what just happened in as few words as
        possible — she should *know* the outcome, not parrot it. Long
        instructional preambles got复述 verbatim in our earlier testing
        ("【当前持有 ground truth】" became a literal台词)，which is
        exactly the "像个机器人一直念" problem we're fixing.

        Transport-level errors get rewritten to body/sensation language
        so the dialog LLM never sees "agent server is not connected" and
        starts narrating about reconnection.
