"""Cross-platform path and content normalization for neko package operations.

Every path that participates in hash computation or archive entry naming MUST
pass through the helpers in this module so that packages built on Windows,
macOS, and Linux produce identical results.

Design decisions
----------------
* Unicode NFC normalization — macOS HFS+/APFS silently converts filenames to
  NFD.  We normalize to NFC (the form used by most other systems and by Python
  string literals) so that the same logical filename always hashes identically.
* Posix-style forward-slash separators — Windows ``Path`` objects use
  backslashes; we always convert to ``/`` before hashing or storing in ZIP.
* Case-sensitive byte-level sorting — ``sorted(key=normalize_archive_key)``
  gives a deterministic order regardless of the OS default collation.
* Dangerous-character rejection — control characters, Windows reserved device
  names, and excessively long components are rejected early so that archives
  remain extractable on all platforms.
