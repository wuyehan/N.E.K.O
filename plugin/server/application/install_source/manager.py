"""InstallSourceManager module-level helpers.

This module implements the path-resolution, error type, atomic-write,
and parser / serializer primitives used by :class:`InstallSourceManager`.
The class itself is added in a later task; for now this file exposes only
the module-level helpers described in design §4.1 / §5.1 / §5.2 / §5.3:

* :func:`resolve_lock_path` — resolves the on-disk lock file path (Req 1.1 / 1.2).
* :func:`classify_plugin_path` — reverse-maps a plugin directory path to its
  ``(root_id, directory_name)`` primary key (design Fix 3).
* :class:`InstallSourceError` — the module's structured exception type.
* :func:`_atomic_write` — POSIX-style atomic file write (Req 1.3 / 1.4 / 12.1 / 12.3).
* :func:`_normalize_ts` — timestamp normalization to ``%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ``
  with graceful fallback (design §3.6 / Fix 7).
* :func:`_parse_lock` — tolerant ``bytes → LockFile`` parser following the
  10-step flow of design §5.1.
* :func:`_serialize_lock` — deterministic ``LockFile → bytes`` serializer
  following the field-order rules of design §5.2.

Do NOT import :mod:`plugin.settings` at module top: reading the user plugin
config root eagerly here would fight the test harness, which overrides the
``PLUGIN_CONFIG_ROOT`` environment variable to point into ``tmp_path``.
:func:`resolve_lock_path` performs the settings lookup lazily on each call.

      stable across interpreter versions.
    * If the parsed datetime is naive (no ``tzinfo``), it is interpreted as
      UTC rather than raising — historical writers may have emitted naive
      strings by accident.
    * The result is always re-rendered via ``strftime(_TS_FORMAT)`` so the
      lexical form is canonical (fixed-width microseconds, trailing ``Z``).
    * On any failure (non-string input, unparseable string, overflow, etc.)
      a WARNING is logged and ``now`` is returned. This is the tolerant
      recovery posture required by Req 14 and Fix 7 — a hand-edited or
      corrupted timestamp must not take down the whole parse.

    1. The byte stream is not valid UTF-8 JSON.

        """Run one three-way diff pass over scanner ↔ in-memory snapshot.

        Implements the design §6.2 pseudocode. Pure CPU work under
        ``self._lock``: we read the current snapshot, call
        ``self.scanner.scan()`` (which touches the filesystem but is
        independent of the snapshot), diff the two, and publish a fresh
        :class:`LockFile` in a single attribute assignment (Fix 2).

        Three kinds of structural change trigger a write:

        * **Add** (disk dir has no lock entry) — seeded via
          :meth:`_seed_entry` with channel derived from ``root_id``
          (``builtin`` → ``"builtin"`` per Req 5.1, ``user`` →
          ``"manual"`` per Req 11.1).
        * **Resurrect** (lock entry has ``removed=True`` but the dir is
          back) — clears ``removed`` / ``removed_at`` and refreshes
          ``last_seen_at`` + ``updated_at`` while preserving
          ``channel`` / ``reason`` / ``installed_at`` / ``bundle_ref``
          (Req 7.4).
        * **Soft delete** (lock entry is live but the dir disappeared)
          — sets ``removed=True`` + ``removed_at=now`` + ``updated_at=now``
          (Req 8.1).

        Two cases are special:

        * ``plugin_id`` backfill — if the lock entry's ``plugin_id`` is
          ``""`` (Fix 1 placeholder) and the scanner now has a real id,
          we patch it in and count the pass as dirty.
        * **No change** — platform-stable entries are carried over
          verbatim (``new_entries[key] = prev``) without touching
          ``last_seen_at``. This is the Fix 4 dirty-check semantics:
          if the whole pass is all-no-change we skip ``save()`` entirely
          and leave ``self._current.updated_at`` alone so the on-disk
          mtime stays put.

        First_Startup: when ``load()`` seeded an empty snapshot with
        ``created_at = now``, branch A naturally walks every disk
        directory through :meth:`_seed_entry` and the trailing
        ``save()`` drops a fully-populated lock file (Req 6.5).

        """Record a ``market`` install in the lock snapshot (Req 10.*).

        Structural mirror of :meth:`record_import` — same classification,
        same ``plugin_id`` eager-read (Fix 1), same builtin guard (Fix 12 /
        Req 5.2), same idempotence contract (Req 10.4) — but writes a
        :class:`SourceDetailMarket` and pins ``channel="market"``.

        Flow (design §8.2):

        1. Resolve ``(root_id, directory_name)`` via
           :func:`classify_plugin_path` (Fix 3). ``PATH_OUTSIDE_ROOTS``
           bubbles up to the caller.
        2. Read ``plugin_id`` eagerly from ``plugin.toml`` via
           :meth:`PluginDirectoryScanner._load_plugin_id` (Fix 1).
        3. Reject if the target dir lives under ``builtin_root``
           (``BUILTIN_CHANNEL_LOCKED``, ERROR log level). The details
           dict carries ``target_channel="market"`` so the caller can
           distinguish this from the ``record_import`` variant.
        4. Build :class:`SourceDetailMarket` with
           ``previous_version=None`` — v1 does not track prior versions
           on the write path (Req 10.5); any upgrade history lives in
           the market backend, not here.
        5. Upsert under ``self._lock``:

           * **New entry**: all three timestamps set to a single ``now``
             (Req 10.6 / 10.7).
           * **Existing entry**: ``installed_at`` preserved (Req 10.4
             idempotence); ``channel="market"``, ``source_detail``,
             ``plugin_id`` (when newly-read is non-empty), ``updated_at``,
             and ``last_seen_at`` updated. The entry is also
             un-soft-deleted. This path also covers the legitimate
             ``channel="imported" → "market"`` overwrite: after Fix 8
             the upload-and-install pipeline no longer double-writes,
             but manual admin recovery / legacy lock files can still
             land on a prior ``imported`` row and we promote it
             in-place.
        6. Publish via :meth:`_replace_entry` + single-assignment (Fix 2)
           and persist via :meth:`save`.

        **Fix 1 — path-priority matching.** When the caller can supply
        the plugin's directory path we classify it into its
        ``(root_id, directory_name)`` primary key and look up the entry
        directly. This is the only reliable path for plugins that were
        just imported / market-installed and whose ``plugin_id`` hasn't
        been read yet — e.g. a lock entry may carry ``plugin_id = ""``
        (Req 3.3) but the primary-key lookup still succeeds
        (design §11.3).

        **Fix 2 — lock-free read.** Like :meth:`list_entries` we
        snapshot ``self._current`` once and operate on the frozen
        object. The method never mutates manager state, never acquires
        ``self._lock``, and never raises: any
        :class:`InstallSourceError` from :func:`classify_plugin_path`
        (e.g. the path is outside both roots) is swallowed and we fall
        through to the ``plugin_id`` fallback. This keeps the
        ``/plugins`` response path a hard 200 even when the caller
        passed a garbage path (Req 15.6).

        Match order (design §11.3):

        1. ``directory_path`` provided → ``classify_plugin_path`` →
           exact ``(root_id, directory_name)`` lookup.
        2. Fallback by ``plugin_id`` text match. When multiple entries
           share the same ``plugin_id`` (e.g. a soft-deleted row plus a
           resurrected one under a different directory), prefer
           ``removed=False``; break ties by the newest ``updated_at``.
        3. Req 4.3 placeholder semantics — if no entry matches
           ``plugin_id`` directly, accept an entry whose ``plugin_id``
           is ``""`` but whose ``directory_name`` equals the caller's
           ``plugin_id``. This covers the narrow window between import
           and the first scanner pass where the directory's id hasn't
           been read yet and the caller only has the directory name to
           work with.

        Return shape:

        * **No match or** ``entry.removed == True`` → a fresh copy of
          :data:`_DEFAULT_INSTALL_SOURCE` (Req 15.2 – 15.5).
        * **Matched live entry** → ``{"source": entry.channel,
          "reason": entry.reason, "installed_at": entry.installed_at,
          "source_detail": <serialized>}``. ``source_detail`` is
          produced by :func:`_serialize_source_detail_for_json` so it
          mirrors exactly what the on-disk JSON would carry (Req 15.1
          / 15.5 / design §5.2).
