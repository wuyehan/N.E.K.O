"""Frozen dataclass types for the plugin install source lock.

All timestamps are carried as already-normalized strings in the format
``%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ`` (UTC). Normalization happens in the Parser; the
models themselves do not validate or coerce timestamps.

``frozen=True`` lets writers publish new :class:`LockFile` snapshots via
a single attribute assignment on the manager — readers always observe a
fully consistent :class:`LockFile` whether they take the pre- or
post-publish state.

    ordering, so reordering this dataclass changes the on-disk byte
    layout — keep it stable.
