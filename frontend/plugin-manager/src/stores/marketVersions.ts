/**
 * Lightweight cache of "what's the latest version of market plugin X on channel C".
 *
 * Loaded lazily when the plugin list view first asks about any installed
 * market plugin. We hit the same ``/plugins`` Market Bridge endpoint that
 * ``MarketPanel`` uses, but we DON'T try to compete with ``MarketPanel``
 * for data ownership — ``MarketPanel`` keeps its own local ref, this
 * store is purely for the install-source "update available" badge on
 * the main plugin list.
 *
 * Cache is keyed by ``${channel}::${slugOrId}``. ``_fetchAll`` fetches
 * the stable and beta channels separately so a plugin installed from
 * beta compares against the beta latest (and stable against stable);
 * otherwise the badge would compare apples to oranges and either hide
 * a real beta update or invent one against the wrong channel.
